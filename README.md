HADES (Heuristic Analysis of Domains &amp; Embedded Sites) is an open-source service in Go for URL analysis and detection of potential online frauds and scams. It applies heuristics such as protocol verification, presence of suspicious words, literal IP, number of subdomains, and domain age via WHOIS, returning a risk score for each analyzed URL.
